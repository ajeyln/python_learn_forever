<h1 align ="Center"> MODULES and TECHNIQUES </h1>

## Background

Python is a programming language and has many concepts and modules. These are used for scripting, data science, and web development etc. <br />

In this repository I have identified some important modules for future references <br />
 
This will be constantly updated with relative exercises to get Handson experience <br />

## Content

The Repository contains the following folders

###  **pandas** 

Pandas is a Python Module for working with Data frames. The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br>

I have referred [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.journaldev.com/29055/python-pandas-module-tutorial#python-pandas-module) <br>

The Module is very helpful to implement the algorithms of Data Sciecne and Machine Learning. <br>

Also for better understanding,  I have solved some python puzzles from [101 Pandas Exercises for Data Analysis](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/) <br>

### **PEP8** 
PEP8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.<br />

I have created notes with help of the link [PEP-8 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0wwmEwqpI&fbclid=IwAR1Q78KGJyPS1arHwc0NGT6LFX1mYiZ54Km5jFhaAyCM6PCQXLnhcTr_F6g) <br />

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution <br />


###   **visual_studio_editor** 

We need an IDE - [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for working with scripts, data and commands. <br>

For our development work, I have chosen **Visual Studio Code Editor** from Microsoft for an IDE <br>

*visual_studio_editor* folder contains my notes, which are prepared with reference from [Visual Studio Code Tutorial- Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-visual-studio-code/) by James Quick

###  **custom_moduling**

Python modules can get access to code from another module by importing the file/function using import method. <br />
The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery <br />

There are mainly two types(Absolute & Relative) of imports in Python

Based on the types of imports in Python, I have created 3 situation in this folder and imported libraries files from source file.

The note created based on the link [Absolute and Relative imports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBYDbAQKs3I)

## To-Dos
[ ] pylint - to imporve the code <br />
[ ] python_enviornment - concept and hands-on <br />
[ ] pytest (module) to unit-test the code <br />  
[ ] pdb - Python debugging <br />
[ ] logging_mechanism_python <br />
[ ] functiontools (module) HIGHER Order functions in python <br />
[ ] json <br />
[ ] pipfile <br />
[ ] decorators in Python <br />
[ ] request  <br />
[ ] flask - for web development <br />
[ ] boto3<br />
[ ] awa_power_tool ( later, not now) <br />
[ ] front_end_web : udemy.com/course/vuejs-fast-crash-course (FREE ON UDEMY) <br />
