## <a name="Background"></a>Background

Python is a programming language and has many concepts and modules. These are used for scripting, data science, and web development etc. <br />

In this repository I have identified some important modules for future references <br />
 
This will be constantly updated with relative exercises to get Handson experience <br />

### <a name="pandas"></a>**pandas** 

Pandas is a Python Module for working with Data frames. The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br>

I have referred [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.journaldev.com/29055/python-pandas-module-tutorial#python-pandas-module) <br>

The Module is very helpful to implement the algorithms of Data Sciecne and Machine Learning. <br>

Also for better understanding,  I have solved some python puzzles from [101 Pandas Exercises for Data Analysis](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/) <br>

### <a name="PEP8"></a>**PEP8** 
PEP8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.<br />

I have created notes with help of the link [PEP-8 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0wwmEwqpI&fbclid=IwAR1Q78KGJyPS1arHwc0NGT6LFX1mYiZ54Km5jFhaAyCM6PCQXLnhcTr_F6g) <br />

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution <br />

### <a name="visual_studio_editor"></a>**visual_studio_editor** 

We need an IDE - [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for working with scripts, data and commands. <br>

For our development work, I have chosen **Visual Studio Code Editor** from Microsoft for an IDE <br>

*visual_studio_editor* folder contains my notes, which are prepared with reference from [Visual Studio Code Tutorial- Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-visual-studio-code/) by James Quick

### <a name="custom_module"></a>**custom_module**

Python modules can get access to code from another module by importing the file/function using import method. <br />
The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery <br />

There are mainly two types(Absolute & Relative) of imports in Python

Based on the types of imports in Python, I have created 3 situation in this folder and imported libraries files from source file.

The note created based on the link [Absolute and Relative imports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBYDbAQKs3I)

### <a name="pylint"></a>**pylint**

Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard. <br>
It can also look for certain type errors and recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored. <br />
The code is given an overall mark, based on the number and severity of the warnings and errors

I have referred [Pylint Tutorial Guide](https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/tutorial.html) <br>

The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="python_virtual_environment"></a>**python_virtual_environment**<br />

Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. 
Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, That's why we need Python virtual enviornment <br />
Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects.This means that each project can have its own dependencies <br />

I have referred [Python Virtual Enviroment Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk)<br>

The folder contains installation steps,and an exercise for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="pytest"></a>**pytest**<br />

pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps us to write better programs.<br />
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional
testing for applications and libraries.<br />

The Module is very helpful for testing scripts <br>
The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="logging"></a>**logging**<br />

Logging is a very useful tool. It helps us to develop a better understanding of the flow of a program and discover 
scenarios.<br />

Logs provide developers with an extra set of information that are constantly looking at the flow.
It can store information, like If an error occurs, then they can provide more insights than a stack trace. <br />

I have referred [Python Logging Basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ARI4Cz-awo) & [Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxmzY9soFXg) by Corey Shafer <br>

The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.<br />
