## <a name="Background"></a>Background

Python is a programming language and has many concepts and modules. These are used for scripting, data science, and web development etc. <br />

In this repository I have identified some important modules for future references <br />
 
This will be constantly updated with relative exercises to get Handson experience <br />

### <a name="pandas"></a>**pandas** 

Pandas is a Python Module for working with Data frames. The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br>

I have referred [Pandas Tutorial](https://www.journaldev.com/29055/python-pandas-module-tutorial#python-pandas-module) <br>

The Module is very helpful to implement the algorithms of Data Sciecne and Machine Learning. <br>

Also for better understanding,  I have solved some python puzzles from [101 Pandas Exercises for Data Analysis](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-pandas-exercises-python/) <br>

### <a name="PEP8"></a>**PEP8** 
PEP8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code.<br />

I have created notes with help of the link [PEP-8 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm0wwmEwqpI&fbclid=IwAR1Q78KGJyPS1arHwc0NGT6LFX1mYiZ54Km5jFhaAyCM6PCQXLnhcTr_F6g) <br />

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution <br />

### <a name="visual_studio_editor"></a>**visual_studio_editor** 

We need an IDE - [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for working with scripts, data and commands. <br>

For our development work, I have chosen **Visual Studio Code Editor** from Microsoft for an IDE <br>

*visual_studio_editor* folder contains my notes, which are prepared with reference from [Visual Studio Code Tutorial- Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-visual-studio-code/) by James Quick

### <a name="custom_module"></a>**custom_module**

Python modules can get access to code from another module by importing the file/function using import method. <br />
The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery <br />

There are mainly two types(Absolute & Relative) of imports in Python

Based on the types of imports in Python, I have created 3 situation in this folder and imported libraries files from source file.

The note created based on the link [Absolute and Relative imports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBYDbAQKs3I)

### <a name="pylint"></a>**pylint**

Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard. <br>
It can also look for certain type errors and recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored. <br />
The code is given an overall mark, based on the number and severity of the warnings and errors

I have referred [Pylint Tutorial Guide](https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/tutorial.html) <br>

The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="python_virtual_environment"></a>**python_virtual_environment**<br />

Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. 
Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, That's why we need Python virtual enviornment <br />
Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects.This means that each project can have its own dependencies <br />

I have referred [Python Virtual Enviroment Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk)<br>

The folder contains installation steps,and an exercise for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="pytest"></a>**pytest**<br />

pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps us to write better programs.<br />
The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional
testing for applications and libraries.<br />

The Module is very helpful for testing scripts <br>
The folder contains my notes and exercises for your reference.  <br />

### <a name="pdb"></a>**pdb**<br />
### <a name="logging_mechanism_python"></a>**logging_mechanism_python**<br />

### <a name="functiontools"></a>**functiontools**<br />

## To-Dos
[ ] logging mechanism<br />
[ ] pdb - Python debugging <br />
[ ] functiontools (module) HIGHER Order functions in python <br />
