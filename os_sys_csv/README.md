File is defined as a set of related data or information. <br />
Folders help us to keep our files organized and separate and folder can have sub folders as well <br />

In this folder, we have created file and folder operation based on following modules 
1. **os** - The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. <br />
2. **sys** - The python sys module provides functions and variables which are used to manipulate paths of the Python Runtime Environment. <br />
3. **csv** -  The csv library contains objects and other code to read, write, and process data from and to CSV files.
