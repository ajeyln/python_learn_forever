Database query is a request to access data from a database to manipulate or retrieve datas <br />
This allows us to perform logic with the information and we get in response to the query <br />

Based on method of querring, There will be two types of operational method <br />
1. Manual Operation
2. Programmin Operations

### <a name="moperation"></a>Manual Operation <br >

Manaual CRUD Operations are, which we are interacting with databases using Desktops applications. <br />

I have used SQLITE3 for the CRUD operations<br />

In this folder, you will find three files
1. querry.txt - In this file, you can find various qurries. Based on the quries, I have created Database and done CRUD operation on it. <br >
2. School.db - It is database, which I have created, to perform CRUD operation on it.
3. school_bkp.db - It is backup database, which I have created during CRUD Operation. 

Note: we can use the link [SQLITE3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)to download desktop application. <br>

### <a name="poperation"></a> Programming Operation <br />
Programming CRUD Operations are, which we are interacting with databases in programatically using sql scripts. <br />

I have used Python Language using SQLITE3 Module for the CRUD operations<br />

In this folder, you will find three files
1. CRUD_Operation.py- A python script, which has queries of databases to perform CRUD operations <br >
2. data_processing.py - A python scripts, which are used to get or manipulate the datas in database <br />
    There are 2 folders in programming_operation folder, which are used for data processing <br >
    + input - In this folder, we can find the data files, according to whcih we need to change the datas in database <br />
    + result - In this, we can find the data information about the databse after changes.
3. School.db - It is database, which I have created, to perform CRUD operation on it.
